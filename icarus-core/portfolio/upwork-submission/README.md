## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Screenshots

Open each HTML file in your browser and take screenshots:

```bash
# Navigate to this directory
cd portfolio/upwork-submission

# Open files (will open in default browser)
# On Windows:
start 01-api-demo.html
start 02-project-overview.html
start 03-test-results.html
start 04-architecture.html

# On Linux/Mac:
xdg-open 01-api-demo.html  # or 'open' on Mac
xdg-open 02-project-overview.html
xdg-open 03-test-results.html
xdg-open 04-architecture.html
```

**Take a full-page screenshot of each one** (use F11 for fullscreen, then screenshot tool)

### Step 2: Fill Out Upwork Form

1. Go to Upwork → Profile → Portfolio → Add Project
2. Open `UPWORK_FORM_CONTENT.txt`
3. Copy-paste content for each field:
   - Project Title
   - Description (596 characters - under 600 limit ✓)
   - Your Role
   - Skills
   - Deliverables

### Step 3: Upload Content

1. **Upload Images**: Add the 4 screenshots you just took
2. **Add Web Link**:
   ```
   https://github.com/brdigetrlol/icarus-core/tree/main/portfolio/rustml-sentiment-api
   ```

## 📸 Screenshot Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Use Full Screen**: Press F11 before taking screenshot
2. **High Resolution**: Use native resolution, don't zoom in/out
3. **Clean Background**: The HTML files already have nice backgrounds
4. **No Browser UI**: Hide browser toolbars if possible (F11 does this)

### Recommended Tools:

- **Windows**: Snipping Tool (Windows + Shift + S) or Snip & Sketch
- **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + 4
- **Linux**: Flameshot or GNOME Screenshot

### Screenshot Order:

1. **01-api-demo.html** → Shows working API examples (most impressive)
2. **02-project-overview.html** → Shows features and metrics
3. **03-test-results.html** → Shows 100% test coverage
4. **04-architecture.html** → Shows technical architecture (optional)

**Upload at least 2-3 images** to your portfolio.
