## Your Proposal (Ready to Paste)

Hi [Client],

I just read your post about needing a high-performance ML API. I recently
built a sentiment analysis platform in Rust that processes 1000+ requests/second
with <5ms latency, which sounds exactly like what you need.

My sentiment API uses:
- Async Rust (Tokio/Axum)
- VADER ML algorithm (95%+ accuracy)
- Docker deployment with auto-scaling
- Comprehensive testing (100% coverage)

Here's my approach for your project:
1. Set up Rust async infrastructure (week 1)
2. Integrate ML models with optimization (week 2)
3. Load testing and performance tuning (week 3)

Rate: $95/hr, estimated 50 hours ($4,750)
Available to start Monday.

Code sample: [15 lines of impressive Rust from your portfolio]

GitHub: [link to sentiment-intelligence-platform]

Let me know if you'd like to discuss the technical details!

**What Claude Code will do**:
1. Analyze your current portfolio
2. Calculate portfolio strength score
3. Provide research framework for:
   - Upwork job counts

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"

Claude Code should auto-detect commands in `.claude/commands/`.

Try:
```
/help
```

Or explicitly:
```
Use the feature-implement command to build a caching layer
```

### "Output not what I expected"

Iterate:
```
That's good, but can you also add [specific requirement]?
```

### "Tests failing"

```
The tests are failing with [error]. Can you fix this?
```
