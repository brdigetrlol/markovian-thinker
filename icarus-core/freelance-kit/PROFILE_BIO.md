## Full Bio (Upwork Overview)
```
👋 I'm a systems engineer specializing in Rust, AI/ML architecture, and high-performance computing.

**What I Build:**
✅ Cognitive AI systems & neural network architectures (SSM, RNN, Liquid Networks)
✅ Async backend services with Tokio (event-driven, scalable systems)
✅ GPU-accelerated applications (CUDA, Vulkan compute shaders)
✅ MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for AI integration
✅ High-performance data processing & real-time systems
✅ Complex system architectures with distributed agents

**Tech Stack:**
• **Languages**: Rust (expert), Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
• **Systems**: Tokio async, event-driven architecture, multi-agent systems
• **AI/ML**: Neural networks, state-space models, semantic embeddings
• **GPU**: CUDA (cudarc), Vulkan compute
• **Tools**: Git, Docker, Linux, CI/CD pipelines

**Recent Projects:**
• Icarus - Novel cognitive AI architecture with 6-agent system & hierarchical memory
• H²CE - Multi-resolution semantic search with hybrid embeddings
• Markovian Thinker - Extended reasoning system with chunk-based iteration
• Task Manager MCP - Autonomous task prioritization with SQLite backend

**Why Work With Me:**
✓ Fast response time (usually within 1-2 hours)
✓ Clean, well-documented, production-ready code
✓ Open source mindset - MIT licensed contributions
✓ Strong communication & regular updates
✓ Testing & quality assurance included

Whether you need a Rust microservice, GPU-accelerated processing, or custom AI architecture - I deliver reliable, performant solutions on time.

Let's build something great together. 🚀
